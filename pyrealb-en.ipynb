    "This Jupyter notebook shows a few live examples of text realization with **pyrealb**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be used directly in your browser (through Binder) with [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lapalme/pyrealb-jupyter/64a7272b3a15404274b1082825af290b4bfee63e?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fpyrealb-en.ipynb). **On opening, select the menu item `Run/Run all cells`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**pyrealb** is a system for realizing English or French Sentences from a specification given as a Python structure built with constructor and function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The names of constructors have been chosen to be similar to the usual conventions in constituent grammars: terminals embedded in phrases each of them can be modified by options specified using object property functions. It is also possible to use a dependency syntax notation to build sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pyrealb** manages automatically conjugation, declensions and most agreements between constituents. One important feature is the fact that once an affirmative sentence has been defined, many variants (e.g. negative, passive, interrogative, etc.) can be obtained by just adding specific options. Not all options are described in this document, the complete list can be found in the [**pyrealb** documentation](docs/documentation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This *Jupyter* notebook briefly introduces **pyrealb** syntax with a few simple examples and also shows more challenging ones.  You can modify the examples and immediately see the effects on the realization. Once an expression is modified, it can be executed with (shift-return) or by clicking one of the appropriate buttoons.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nota bene*: When **pyrealb** detects a specification error which often results in realizing a word between double square brackets `[[...]]`, it also writes a warning on the console which is displayed before the result. \n",
